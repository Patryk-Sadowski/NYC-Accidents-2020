 # New York Accidents Dashboard
 
## Project Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis about collision of vahicle reported by the New York Police Department from January to August 2020. The analysis aims to uncover trends and patterns in traffic collisions in New York City. It is an educational project designed to reinforce knowledge from online courses.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: Used for structured querying and data manipulation to prepare the dataset for visualization.
- **Tableau**: Utilized for data modeling, creating measures and designing the dashboard visualizations.

## Insights and Conclusions
The NY Accidents Dashboard provides several key insights:
- The highest number of accidents occurred in the winter period from January to March. This was probably due to the difficult weather conditions that prevail on the roads during this period.
- Taking into account the daily distribution of accidents. It should be noted that the highest number of accidents occur in the afternoon between 1 PM and 6 PM.
- The main contributing factor to the accident was driver distraction.
- The most common victims in accidents were drivers themselves, second were pedestrians, and third were cyclists. The number of injured and killed accident participants is also in the same order.
